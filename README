This library is meant to provide functionalities and fixes that QT doesn't.
As such it contains chunks of platform dependent code.
If something can be done using only QT APIs, then it shouldn't be here.

Currently, here is what it provides:
OSX:
- media key handling
- apple remote support
- Lion fullscreen (fallback on regular if not available)
- some QT4/QT5 migration quirks
- zeroconf helpers

Older bits of code in there were meant to help positioning windows, proper frameless windows, etc.

ZeroConf stuff largely stolen from http://doc.qt.digia.com/qq/qq23-bonjour.html

Licensed under BSD2.
