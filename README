qt-roxeeplatipus
================

Various standalone stuff to help the webroxer (mainly devices for now).
This is meant to hold platform stuff that QT doesn't implement at all, or implement partially / bogusly.
Typically, Lion FullScreen support, proper frameless window, remote control support, etc.
